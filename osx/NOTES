Internal Development Notes
==========================
GUI sometimes blank. Sometimes crashes:

-top view accidentally of the NSCustomView class instead of NSView


Spawning error "no such file to load -- libyaml (LoadError)" on
deploy of embedded app

- rubygems are probaby required somewhere. They shouldn't(?) in
  an embedded app



Continuous error messages on spawn. Just added a new controller
to the top level.

- forgotten to select nib file in the object
